/* Filename:  btread.cpp

   Programmer:  Br. David Carlson

   Date:  November 4, 1997

   Last Modified:  December 21, 2001 to use the NULLCHAR constant.

   This is a program to read a B-tree-based table (in btree.dat file) - as
   produced by the btmake program.  This program prompts the user to
   enter a word and then displays the associated definition, if a
   match was found.  The user can do repeated lookups of this sort, until
   a . is entered to quit.
 
   In order to compile this program under Visual C++, you will need to have
   the following files listed in the project:
   btree.cpp   itemtype.h   btread.cpp   btree.h     table.h

   Tested with:
      Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
      Microsoft Visual C++ .NET
      g++ under Linux
