B-Tree Example
==============

This is a completely coded example. It is adapted from the B-tree coded in 
Ch 10 of the Kruse text listed as a reference at the very end of this web 
page. Note that the code below is for a B-Tree in a file unlike the Kruse 
example which makes a B-tree in main memory. 

The purpose of forking the code is to study how b-tree works.
